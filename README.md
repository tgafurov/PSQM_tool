# PSQM_tool

Power System Quick Modelling (PSQM) tool is a free set of Octave/Matlab functions intended for performing steady-state power flow and fault current calculations. PSQM tool is a complement to the existing Matpower package. The tool has been developed in order to:   
-	Simplify advanced modelling of power systems particularly medium voltage networks; 
-	Enable fault analysis including for unbalanced faults (phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase, double phase to ground). 

PSQM tool is distributed under the 2-clause (simplified) BSD-license.

Note that there is no support for PSQM tool. All necessary information about the tool usage is provided in the manual. If you find an error in the calculations please use the “Issues” section.
